# MontecitoMudslides2018
Simulation of debris and mud flow down the Santa Ynez mountains, which heavily affected the area of Montecito, California.

The senior thesis PDF sums up the results and gives an overview of the project.
Code is available under the corresponding folder and some movies were provided.
The data consists of a mix of GIS contour data as well as smoothed million-pixel matrices which are too big to put on github.
The data is available upon request to alejandro.stawsky@gmail.com.
Extra movies are also available for the work done on simulation lava flowing down the oraefajokull volcano in Iceland.
Special thanks to Professor Bjorn Birnir.
